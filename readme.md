## Background

Front is build with Meteor & React.
Bacn is build with Python Flask.

Purpose was to create a retro looking website for bars, so their bartenderds can take song requests from clients.

This project was originally finished in 2020 summer.

The project is far from perfect and retrospectively I should have used unit tests to keep the code clean.
